# Agenda

## Bond (15-30 min.)
-   ~Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)~
-   We did listening and check-in.

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?
- +1 Feels good to ADD to backlog.  Would also like to REMOVE from backlog.
- +1 Bonding felt good.  It is important.
- Confusing that when adding points, it does not show the role you need to add points for, but the next role.

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- Dogfooding +2  -- Amazing how quickly we got ideas within a few minutes.  Would not have been seen without playing the game.
- Incorporating new ways of working into the game.
- Flow worked well today

### Other observations
- Should have used feature toggle before changing code (instead of failing test).  It is not explicit obout controlling deployment.  It uses implicit test about features to control deployment.  Maybe use environment variable.

- Personal notes -- This is a good general practice.  Remind mob at session start.  It is good at managing speak/non-speak (independently of thinking).  Decouple mouth and mind.

- Allow different mobs to configure the role->skill mapping.  Would allow all different kinds of games - (e.g. strong style) 

- Michael went to Mendercon which was great. Make new friends

- We are disregarding the timer (maybe because of the activities we do?)
  - There was no sound when the timer expired

- +2 We should decouple the timer
  - Can practice using the timer you will be using in the real world
  - Should be able to turn the timer off (by default?)


### Agenda hacks
- Mix of baclog refinement vs doing work (target 15%)
- Target 1 (full) hour on coding


### Ideas

-   Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
