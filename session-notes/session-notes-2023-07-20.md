# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)
[ ] Let michael talk eventualy

- taking notes - typing own's ideas while typing for others

### 

- as the first talker - there's less freedom, due to our working agreements - when we start, we always start this specific way
  - Disciplinarian? not following working agreements
- if the typist notices something, and nobody else is speaking up, should the typist talk?
  - it depends :)
- it's uncomfortable having a disagreement / a conflict
  - I rather do it in a mediocre way than not do it at all
    - this time - it was direct
  - seeing my own behavior reflected in somebody else's behavior
    - experience it from both sides / non-judgemental self-observer
    - "as a comunity"
  - how did it affect me and how did that feel
  - similiar to dancing with someone
- I'm talker, and we're doing TDD, and I miss 'red' - I'd like the typist to say "you missed the 'red'"
  - there are times when I. would like the talker to pause before doing something out of the agreement
- There's a difference between when typist does this vs. a mobber does it.
  - Typist has a position already
  - Maybe - prefer allowing others to intervene - to get out of a too-tight feedback loop
  - I'd prefer the mob say it first, rather than the typist
  - Typist is the "fingers" / "instrument" in service of the mob's thinking
  - I like "turning off my brain" as typist
- As a talker, I prefer my typist to do exactly as instructed; iow, I want my typist to follow me
  - this *is* the agreement of mobbing
- example: "let's just mob on it" - Gregor meant it as "let's not follow our agreement, and just do it!" - going for lightweight
- I like when the Typist types what the Talker is **intending**
- Consider - If typer has an idea, they can first ask
- When Typist does it differently than the Talker imagined
  - Sometimes it's fine
  - But some other times the Talker can say "let's do it the other way"

### Dancing Analogy

- Is the Talker the Lead? Typist follows
  - Is the Talker *leading* the group or *facilitating* the group?
  - The Talker is verbalizing the current intention of the mob
    - Emphasized by thumb voting at the end of a turn
  - As the Typist's focus is on serving the Talker; The Talker's focus is serving the mob
- Still tend to over-lead when we agreed she's the lead
- An error can turn into a good beautiful thing
- "You lead now" three bars later... "I lead now"

## Further discussion role of talker:
who is the tie breaker?
can the talker make the final decision?
Question:  when i am representative
 the mob is leading, we are not coming to a quick agreement
 it feels like we are out of the flow and 

 IMPORTATNT: have a biased to action
 is it the responsiblity of the representiative to take action and DECIDE
 ----
 example: last week
 
one idea would be that the representative could then identify what they observe, and facilitate a decision
another option would be that the representative to just decide
another option would be to do both (but probably the first one would be good enough and we wouldnt do the second)
 
Question did we identify a change that would make it more comfortable for Michael?
  The representative role - Yes and.

Lets not overload the role
It's skills to do all of these


### How did that feel?
Fast/Slow/Medium? -- 
- Focused - just right.  
- Fast (for ports).  Slow (later).
- Slow (Nitsan).  Getting on same page.
- Slow (Diana).  Wonders if _she_ slowed it down.  Thougt "no".
- frustrated - as Talker, did not get a chance to talk
  - sometimes worked well, and sometimes not
  - served me: at times, took my thought and asked "how should that happen?"
  - tripped me: giving inputs not in line with my thinking
- Diana feels psychologically safe, likes to mob with Joel
- Its a great Mob


### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- It was good to go slow to get on same page (else it will catch up with us later).
- Very disciplined work.  (e.g. commit message (good text), how to do documentation)
- Thumb voting (for quick decisions)
- Continually asking if we are going in a good direction.
- Asking about correct directein at end of each 5-minute rotation.
- Longer rotations felt OK (despite earier opinion).  It gives space for talker.
- Longer timer relaxes Gregor when someone else is talking in his space (turn).  Plus-one.
- when deleting from backlog - great suggestion by Gregor - going one line at a time; also helpful for the typist - how to implement the vision?
- (Michael) deleting text.  Letting git(1) remember.
- Michael - wnen Gregor said "Let's mob it" as a transition
- after getting feedback - asking for specific examples

### What did we _DO_?-

- Ports
- Agreed to do a visible change
- Cleaned up backlog
  - should we keep things forever? (git will remember / it'll come up again later if important)
- Discussed many ways to do timer.  Chose one to experiment.  Decorated 'name' to show logic of 'role'.

### Ideas

-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).
