# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- +1 Eager to implement change in app behavior!
- felt kind-of-stuck, feeling of "maybe one more thing..."; another example: the hidden input field used only for tests
  - identify when we're in "weird problem" space and timebox / thumb-vote it
- switching mob roles adds load; maybe make rotations longer
- lots of small problems; potential to get stuck; but we didn't get stuck, we were able to move on; 
- not caught-up / tried on: feeling of "I'm stupid" - this stopped working after a while / tried on: "it's the only way (mobbing) that can work"; meta - watching my thoughts
- somebody passing their turn, not wanting to be talker / typist - this might be a smell; are we too deep into a rabbit-hole? is the cognitive load too high? can we make it easier for the team?

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- thumb-vote to stop - make it explicit whether it's stopping or not
- iso "make it bigger"; clearer - "make the terminal taller"
- "don't change it yet, let's just listen and understand"

### Ideas

- [x] on timer expires "my intention was ... do we want to keep going?" / "do we want to stop?" 
/ "any rabbit-hole concerns?" (are we stuck?)
- [x] .gitpod.yml: ports: ignore the integration tests ports range
- [ ] for next time - see if the app opens for everybody joining the gitpod workspace
-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).

could you please summarize what happened?

```

```
here are notes from today's mob programming session retro

please summarize
and aslo - go up one or two levels asking "why?" (values, etc.)
```
