# Agenda

## Bond

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Goals

-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect

### How did that feel?
????? Anyone!!!!
- Slightly awkward w/ dramatic group change
- Productive.  Made steps forward.
- Interesting.  New group dynamic.
- Stone soup.  Everyone brought something.  (i.e. inferring types)
- Went amazingly well
    - Bringing 2 new People to the group
- Happy Dance
- Learned a lot
    - How to use the UI
        - 
    - How to use the Language

### Something Surprising?
- How quickly Emily picked it up
- Liked having Gitpod to have my own view of the code without disturbing the typist
- But you have to manually open the right files when you're "Next"
- The 3 Tab setting with the mobtimer, so I could easily figure out whos in what position
- Let's just do it! Leaning in the uncomfortable, trusting the process. I found that more effective.
    - Is an advanced place to be (mature)

#### Observations & Insights
- More heterogenous.
- Decider protocol (Jim McCarthy) could help.
- Interrupt protocol is not a group norm (for this new group).
- If many people are giving typist input, it can be ????.
- Input style could be per-navigator (i.e. "I like to be directed this way or that way")
- A lot of people learned a lot of things.
- For a relatively new group, it was ???Joel-what did you say?---
- Decider Protocol could help.  And... it went well already.
- With controversial thoughts, we went deep.  Valuable learnings.  Would not have happened alone.
- Having TODO list made it very easy to pick up.
- TODO was like "bread crumbs".  Retro template -> Backlog -> GET BUSY.
- We may not have left good-enough bread crumbs for next session.
- Stopping with enough time at end of session 1 is a goodd practice for transition to session 2.


### What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- Nitsan giving recap of how we got here (accessor, Player, types, compler option, correct squigglies(or not))
- Once we bring to surface, what do we do?
- Bringing in two new people
- Emily found the Backlog immediately (The Backlog file works!)
- The benefits of improving our documentation


### Idea
-   Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect Session 2

- changed settings in typescript to disallow implicit any - at first it was interesting, but now it's annoying. Fixing it is not worth it. Only fix types where it has some value, and ignore the rest.
- don't see ROI in changing all the getters. There are more valuable things to work on.
- liked when we allowed longer driving, and didn't have this fast rotation. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it isn't. 
  - Depends on the group (size). 
  - In a smaller group it's OK to finish the thought. 
  - In a larger group, keeping the time is better, so everyone has a chance to become driver/navigator.
- made the second session last until 7pm - just as long as the first one. 5h is too much when attending both sessions.
- enjoyed the longer rotation time, with that group
    - it felt rewarding to finish something
- agree with 2h instead of 3h in the second session (3h is too long)
- lesson on bash +1
- interresting to listen to the retro of the first session
- It was nice to listen to Session 1 retro as a start to Session 2.  That made it a warm start, not a cold start.
- coming in when the group was already warm, i found it interresting to listen to the retro of the first session
- it was not like a cold start
- It was interesting to span both sessions.   The break was important.
- It's valuable to span sessions to bring session 1 knowledge to session 2.
- It was helpful to be in session 2 as though it was a completely new session, not just a continuation of session 1.
- Having 2 sessions is a good experiment to keep running.
