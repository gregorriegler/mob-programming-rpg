# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### Learned

- cmd+shift+P - search anything in VSCode IDE
- Implement a component :
```tsx
{EarnPointsForRole({ showEarnPointsForRoleForm, role, uiState, earnPoints })}
Implement the EarnPointsForRole using JSX format (sim to HTML)
<EarnPointsForRole showEarnPointsForRoleForm={showEarnPointsForRoleForm} role={role} uiState={uiState} earnPoints={earnPoints} />
```
- `npm test` - run all tests
- `npm start` - run the app

// pass in a signle oblect. as the Props object
//now from JSX. we can instantiat it in JSX style
"convert parameters to destructured object" - using the quick fix menu, we had to place te cursor on the function name
function DianaTempFunction({ param1, param2 }: { param1; param2; })

### noticed

- long component names - two similar names got merge in my mind into one component - created confusion about the code
- state as a global variable - makes things hard to understand
- we have two kinds of state - game state, UI state
- adding points flow - hard to understand; maybe some different terminology - "show/hide" / "expand/collapse"
- confusing: clicking "earn" shows the form, but no straight forward way to hide it back
- bonding - took one hour today; alot of valuable stuff; like it a lot! but also like coding, wish we had more time; and we actually stayed longer today

### How did that feel?

- overall felt good, enjoyable
- we don't have a good way of stopping if something doesn't work; what's our process for stopping?
  - one option - just keep going
  - another - commit a broken state
- felt attached to the work, but actually we could reach it in a different way
- the thing that we're solving is quite complex, need to keep a lot in the head, worried that after today it'll take me a while to be able to hold it in my head again

### Discussion
two situations when we might want to stop:
if we are in the session and we get to a bad state
   we could go back to green

discovered: Button isnt a button
we could have rolled back and inline the button instead of it being a button
go back to previous green and try a smaller step

we changed too many things at one 
the problem was coming from the onclick handler

if we go down a path - we learned something; if we go back to green, we're already smarter, we can choose a different path

today we haven't been choosing to go back to green


### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- we were in the flow, throughput; wanted to complete this here and now
- safe space, when not remembering the domain, was able to type w/o feeling uncomfortable of scared
  - Nitsan said "you know what to do...", Typist said "no I don't" (w/o judgement), continues to respond w/o judgement in a verbose answer, then understood

### Ideas

-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).

## Summary (Generated by ChatGPT)

Useful command for today's changes:

```shell
git diff --ignore-all-space `git log --since="1 day ago" --pretty=format:%H | tail -1`
```

Useful prompts:

```
Here are all the changes made to the repo during a single mob programming session

could you please summarize what happened?
what are some main points from the retro that was help at the end?
```

```
here are notes from today's mob programming session retro

please summarize
and aslo - go up one or two levels asking "why?" (values, etc.)
```
