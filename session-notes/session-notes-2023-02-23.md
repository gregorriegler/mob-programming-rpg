# Goals
- create a global backlog
- create a microretro template
- Finish up the refactor test path
- Keep on refactoring primitive obsession
    - it('limit number of points to 3 per role' <-- test on Score
    - Player.pointsFor and percentageFor is only used in Tests!!
- improve on font https://github.com/gregorriegler/mob-programming-rpg/issues/4


# Retro

## How did that feel?
- Good to be back
- Haven't joined often, but still remember things we are doing
    - There is kind of continuity
- Gregor really enjoyed working with Tsvetan because it felt really smooth and a lot of progress was made. It showed that Tsvetan had all the testing, refactoring and design skills needed. It was really enjoyable
- Gregor felt really good and is glad that we made so much progress
- Tsvetan also really joined the session
- Tsvetan learned a lot from Gregor
- Tsvetan: Wanted to make the method extraction in bigger steps
    - But Gregor suggested to first extract in the method in the local class, and then move it to the proper class
- Tsvetan didn't feel a lot time passed by, even though we worked longer
- Gregor: Really happy that people continue to join and progress is being made. It's living on

## What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- Gregor noticed that Tsvetan was already looking ahead about what needs to get refactored next
- Even though we were at a point where we had to search for the next to refactor, we didn't have to search for it
- Tsvetan made sure we didn't have any wait time between refactoring ideas
- Our refactoring was very disciplined, with small steps and lots of commits
- We stayed green all the time
- Strictness of the rotation +1
- The way the Mob welcomed someone being late
    - It didn't feel obligated, so was happy to join and participate
- Gregor: Encouraging everybody to have the timer sound on prevents reminding people that they should switch
- Gregor: Rotations with screensharing on is really smooth
- Gregor: Liked the new backlog and the way we work with docs and retrofiles. It has a self-explanatory protocol with hyperlinks. You just open the markdown and have a link to the next file you need

## Observations
- While working on this, we're developing a way to work remotely, together, on code. We're developing a mob programming protocol
- In this group the mob programming practice evolves particularly well. Gregor works in another group with juniors and they have difficulties in evolving their mob protocols
