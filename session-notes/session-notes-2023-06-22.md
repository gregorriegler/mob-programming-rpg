# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect!! / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- sad we couldn't get the "VSCode React Refactor" extension to work
- surprised - getting the idea to encapsulate the "earn points" in a different way, did not see it before
  - got many small ideas about the extensions
  - and many ideas about the refactoring
  - but didn't do those ideas :)
  - but we did capture some good notes
  - should we have focused more about a single idea at a time? Pick one, and go with it.
- confused by not completing a rename, e.g. leaving "newFunction" / "applesauce" for a long time
  - should we commit "applesauce"?
    - not committing introduces a risk - veering away from green
    - maybe commit but not push
  - separate the efforts - thinking about structure vs. naming
  - however if you already know the name - just do it immediately
  - The power of naming as a process, each step is obvious
    If you name it applesauce:
    GTD (getting things done) terms
    The "next action" is captured in the name
    Applesauce means “PLEASE NAME ME!”
- feel safe in this mob
- after taking notes as todos in the code, without "bias towards action"; wasn't bad, and gave us an experience
  - first felt sad, then "it may not matter", then relieved that others did the same

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Learned a lot of new things today
  - gitpod and extensions, different ways of adding extensions, some ext. do not work
- by looking directly at the rendered html (the app) - we were able to discuss potential boundaries and relationships between components
- discussing "how to name this?" - clarifies the thing itself
- coming in not at the start of the session - "I don't have my env set up"; we could have responded with "we think it's easy, would you like to do it now?"
- learned! "i before e except after c, or sounded as 'ay' as in neighbor"
  - receipt
  - conceive
  - believe
  - unbelievable
  - grateful to have received this inconceivable unbelievable knowledge from my good neighbor
  - Color (US)
  - neighbor, weigh; color vs colour (British spelling)

## Summary (Generated by ChatGPT)

Here's a summarized version of the notes from your mob programming session retrospective:

Participants in the session experienced a range of emotions, from sadness due to technical difficulties (like the failure of the "VSCode React Refactor" extension), surprise from innovative ideas and different viewpoints, and confusion due to incomplete tasks such as renaming functions. The group questioned if they should have focused more on individual ideas rather than branching out. They also noted the value and importance of naming as a part of the process, as it captures the next step and signals areas that need attention.

Participants generally felt safe in the group and found value in the method of taking notes as to-do items in the code, which eventually led to relief in finding others who adopted the same practice. This was viewed as a learning experience.

The group found that direct examination of the rendered HTML enabled fruitful discussions about the boundaries and relationships between components. Learning new things, such as how to use gitpod and extensions, and the nuances of language and spelling were also beneficial. Coming into a session midway didn't present a significant problem, as they could set up their environment in real-time.

Moving forward, the group has a few ideas. They considered renaming other form props types similarly to RoleSheetProps and also emphasized the need to clear up ambiguous names like "applesauce". Before refactoring, they suggested organizing the code to prevent premature scattering of code. Finally, they mentioned creating a backlog for ideas generated in this session.

At a higher level, this session emphasizes the values of collaboration, open communication, continuous learning, and respect for individual ideas within the team. It also underlines the importance of naming in coding processes, and how it plays a crucial role in code clarity and future action points. It is apparent that creating a safe environment for each participant is a key element of the group's operations, facilitating deeper exploration and shared understanding.

what can you further infer?
```

Based on the notes from the mob programming session, a few additional inferences can be made:

Process Over Results: The team seems to prioritize the process of working together and learning from each other over merely delivering results. They have a strong focus on learning and continuous improvement, indicating a mature and growth-oriented mindset. This approach is likely to strengthen their collaborative skills over time and improve the quality of their work.

Empathy and Psychological Safety: The participants felt comfortable sharing their feelings and thoughts. They've created an environment where they feel safe to discuss both successes and challenges, indicating a high level of psychological safety, which is a crucial factor in effective team dynamics. This environment fosters open dialogue, encouraging every member to contribute, share ideas, and learn.

Value of Naming and Organization in Code: The importance of proper naming and code organization is recognized, indicating that the team understands the need for readable and maintainable code. They understand that good naming conventions can improve code understanding and reduce future technical debt.

Active Handling of Ambiguities: They show a proactive approach to resolving ambiguities, be it in the code ("applesauce") or understanding roles and responsibilities (considering renaming form prop types similarly to RoleSheetProps). This suggests an awareness of the potential for misunderstanding and confusion, and a readiness to handle it early on.

Respect for Individual Ideas: The note about a participant feeling their idea was taken and restated by another indicates that the group values original ideas and respects individual contributions. This situation also indicates a need for clearer communication protocols or guidelines to prevent such misunderstandings and ensure every member feels their contribution is valued.

Adaptive and Flexible: The team is flexible and adaptive, as seen by the ease with which a member joining mid-session was integrated. This suggests a supportive team culture, prepared to accommodate different work rhythms and circumstances.

In sum, the team seems to exhibit a productive and healthy dynamic, characterized by openness, continuous learning, empathy, respect for individual ideas, and a focus on process over results. They also demonstrate a solid understanding of good coding practices. Some areas for potential improvement could be the development of clearer communication protocols and maintaining focus during their sessions.

### Ideas

-   [ ] should we rename other form props types similar to `RoleSheetProps`?
-   [x] clear up "applesauce"
-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).
-   [ ] Prepare for refactoring by first moving code closer together, etc. (to organize the code and avoid scattering code prematurely; e.g., find all the earn points related code in RoleSheet.tsx, put together, and then extract/refactor/move)
      - "Person B said 'as a process' instead of 'as a pattern.'"
      - NOTE: Pattern Vs Process
        When Person B redescribed it
        Person A - slight feeling of you took my idea , restated it and called it your own
        Might have been less triggering:
        I agree with what Person B said and
        I might call it something slightly different
