# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- Happy we got it done
- We went Semi TDD
  - Wasnt very strict, added functionality without a failing tests
  - Added tests after the fact
    - and its fine
- Bothered that we are doing it on production (without the feature toggle)
- Feels very easy to work together +1
  - Increase the timer -> just did it
- Michael sad we should run the app and see it before we commit, brought us back to the safety mindset
- Felt like a good team
- Wanted to be explicit about my expectations (wanna be part of a team, be productive, try a different way of working)
  - Wanted to experiment
  - I got all of them
- Comfortable
- Uncomfortable (the unknown was in the code)
- Pretty amazing! We rocked it!
  - Got a lot of good things done / and the way to do them
  - as opposed to previous session - in this session, no stuggling at all
  - was fun, enjoyed it
- Noticed: we were so in the flow, we forgot about the time

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Revealing confusion
  - We benefit from each others confusion / misunderstanding
- Adapting the timer to the actual way we rotate (from 3m to 5m)
- We were quite effective in finding a shared understanding. What was it that made that happen?
- We had many agreements

### Ideas

-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).
