# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### Observations

- Diana - named the "how", not the "what"
  - the "what" is very interesting
    - a meta game, playing it while mobbing - like Willem's game (the Mob Programming RPG)
    - the game keeps track of learning and experiences while mobbing
- Different ways of starting a mob / different flow
- learned about stow (its like stash)
- Diana was courageous to ask for a demo of the game
- Consistent language is important, calling out on bad naming
- There are so many new things to learn for a new person, lots of details. Its important to acknowledge that
- The first terminal is the one that is shared among all participants
- browser not allowing screen share - no panic, relaxed resolving the issue - how was it fixed??
  - what browser are you using Gather in?
  - click the link for Security and Privacy

### How did that feel?

- Glad to be here, not what I expected
- Appreciate - Gregor asked to wait before clicking the commit button, so we can add the co-authors
- Felt rushed to follow along the gitpod set-up
- Solve for Safety
- Trust the mob about the slower typer rotation pattern - no need to set aside extra brain power

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Documentation, session notes, backlog - like!
- Session Notes: inactive co-authers (join the mob in the past), it's quick to select current co-authers, prepared for our commits, easy and clear to use
- Onboarding a new person
- Prompt Engineering for Teaming / "Collaborative Coding"
- Gregor - Gitpod demo - first show patiently, only then expect the team to follow
- Diana - verbelizing aloud current understanding, to get coached in real time
- Typer rotates slower pattern. Using the timer to keep track. Was clear how this works.
- +3 Diana asking clarifying Qs, and verbalizing thoughts
  - effortless, felt safe, familiar
- Gregor - Good to have an "expert beginner" join the mob
- good follow-up on previous session's note about slowing down, no rushing, very relaxed, nice pace
- Gregor explaining the reason for a single terminal - it's the only one that's shared

### Ideas

- make it easier to setup the repo locallly
- when pair facilitating / coaching - one coach could take on the role of a personal "buddy" for a newbie
- Take the role of watching a newbie's screen with them
- Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
- Invite new participants to verbalize their observations and ideas at any time
- Would be nice to have a terminal for the tests and another one for the game
  - Nitsans Taste: One Terminal at a time
