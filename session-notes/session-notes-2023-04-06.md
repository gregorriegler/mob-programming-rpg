## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

-   Liked - something that could be `undefined` according to type system, but can it even be `undefined`? so let's remove this possibility by logic
-   Liked - not all paths in a method had a return value; `noImplicitAny` forced us to deal with this hidden fact - adding the default return path - we've decided on `return 0;`
-   Liked this early session, wondering if we need both sessions; a single session removes the need for synchronization; Should we make the earlier session 2.5 / 3 hours long?
-   Could do a totally off-topic activity, like liberating structures, or a kata
-   I would like do katas in pairs/mob and record, because it could be interesting to other people. Also the feedback would be interesting.
    -   Do a lot of katas on my own, but not enough with other people
-   Liked it today
-   Felt we were on the same page
-   Cleaning the project makes sense
-   Wonder if there are more important things to do
-   How much time do we want to spend addressing technical debt vs implementing new features?
-   Usually I only fix technical debt that is in my vicinity of what I currently work on
-   Idea: Leave noImplicitAny flag on, but work on new features, and only fix the code in our vicinity.

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

### Idea

-   Crazy Product Owner constraint for Kata
-   Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
