# Task: perform cleanup on files

## Input

The files have names like
         session-notes-2022-10-20.md
         session-notes-2022-11-03.md
         session-notes-2022-11-10.md
         session-notes-2022-11-24.md
         session-notes-2022-12-01.md

The files are in markdown format.  

Specifically, 1st-level headers have 1 "#" at beginning of line and 2nd-level headers have "##"... likewise for 3rd-level

## Cleanup

All regular expresssion 'match' and 'substitute' operations should do case-insensitive matching.

Create code to accomplish each sub-task in Python


### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'get_date_from_filename'
  - parameter: filename
  - return: date portion of the filename

### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'slurp_file'
  - parameter: filename
  - return: entire contents of file as a string

### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'contains_inactive_coauthors'
  - argument: contents
  - return: boolean.  true iff 'contents' matches (case-insensitive) a 1st or 2nd level header with "Inactive Co-Authors"

### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'contains_active_coauthors'
  - argument: contents
  - return: boolean.  true iff 'contents' matches (case-insensitive) a 1st or 2nd level header with "Active Co-Authors"

### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'contains_session_date'
  - argument: contents
  - return: boolean.  true iff 'contents' matches (case-insensitive) a 1st or 2nd level header with "Session Date"

### Sub-task: Create subroutine: 'delete_inactive_coauthors'
  - argument: contents
  - action: if there is a 1st or 2nd level header that matches "Inactive Co-Authors", delete the whole section (i.e. the header through, but not including, the next header)
  - return: none.  But assure that the argument has changes if they were made

### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'normalize_coauthor_heading'
  - argument: contents
  - action: Any header that contains "Co-Author", whether or not it contains other text, should be rewritten to be a 2nd-level header with only "Co-Authors"
  - return: none.  But assure that the argument has changes if they were made

### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'cleanup_file'
  - argument: filename
  - actions
     1. slurp file contents into variable 'original_contents' and also 'contents'.
     2. set 'date_as_string' from 'filename'
     3. if 'contents' does not contain session date, add a 1st-level header to the beginning with "Session Date" followed by value of 'date_as_string'
     4. if 'contents' contains active coauthors AND 'contents' contains inactive coauthors, delete inactive coauthors
     5. if 'contents' and 'original_contents' are different
     	a. Notify user that changes have been made
        b. create a new file to contain changed text
           - name based on oiginal name with .new appended
           - same mode as original file
           - same modification times as original file
	    c. write 'contents' to the *.new file
        d. rename original file to have ".original" appended to filename
        e. rename file with new text (and .new appended) to original filename
        f. output a command that user can type to compare the following files.  Assure that the command is alone on a line to make it easier to coyy/paste.
  	    - original file (*.original file name)
	    - new file (original file name)
     5. if 'contents' and 'original_contents' are identical, tell the user that no changes were made
     6. Exit with return codes similar in intent to diff(1)

### Sub-task: Create subroutine 'main'
    - foreach filename given on the command line, pass the filename to "cleanup_file"
	 
### Sub-task: Consolidate code
    - Display all sub-task code in python code block
