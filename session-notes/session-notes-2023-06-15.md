# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- starting out - felt good, good flow, Driver at different pace
- liked! got into coding, more coding than usual
- later got into a bit of trouble how to test the UI, less flow
- it (the UI) froze even though the tests were green, making me less confident
- small commits - feels awesome!
- liked! opening Q - "what was the most adventurous thing you did?" - being deliberate at getting to know each other better

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- good intents!
- on the other hand - too many intents at the same time; we might want to get better at **finishing** the current thing before starting the next thing; agreed - too many things up in the air at once
- Like! [Driver timer](https://github.com/gregorriegler/polybar-egg-timer)
- doing more of the same - extracting more React components (progress bar, earn points button)
- three different ways to git commit

### Ideas

- [ ] when noticing too many things giong at once - write them down right there in the code as comments
- [ ] keep track of (capture) ideas (rabbit holes) in a mindmap
- [ ] Inbox metaphor: You write things down but you don't care what they are. The important thing is to get them out of your head. +1
- [ ] Public Inboxes
- [ ] would be nice to search for a vscode extention to directly **extract a react component**
-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).

here are notes from today's mob programming session retro

please summarize

Summary:

In the recent mob programming session retro, participants expressed a generally positive experience. The start of the session was deemed successful, with participants enjoying the good flow and getting into coding more than usual. The introduction of small commits was well received, and the 'Driver timer' tool was also appreciated.

However, there were some challenges, particularly related to UI testing where the UI froze even with green tests, leading to decreased confidence. Another issue raised was the management of multiple intents at the same time, creating a sense of too many open tasks. Participants agreed on the need for focusing on completing current tasks before moving onto new ones.

Several ideas were proposed for future sessions. Suggestions included writing down multiple tasks in code comments when they seem to accumulate, capturing ideas in a mindmap, and the concept of a public inbox for ideas. There was also a desire for a VSCode extension that could directly extract a React component, along with the mention of maintaining a global backlog for ideas to be implemented in future sessions.

Asking "Why?":

The fact that participants felt a good flow initially and appreciated more coding indicates a value for productivity and engagement in coding tasks. However, when the flow was disrupted, especially during UI testing, this showed a need for reliable testing tools to build confidence in their work.

The problem with handling multiple tasks simultaneously shows a desire for better task management and the importance of maintaining focus on the current task for the sake of efficiency. This reflects the value of organized, structured work and the avoidance of multitasking, which can lead to inefficiency and confusion.

The suggested ideas reflect a proactive approach to problem-solving, including maintaining an organized approach to idea management, and seeking useful tools to streamline their tasks (like the VSCode extension). This suggests values of innovation, organization, and efficiency.

The appreciation of small commits indicates a value for gradual, continuous progress, where each step forward is celebrated and adds to the overall confidence in the task at hand.

Lastly, the deliberate effort to get to know each other better reveals an understanding of the importance of team dynamics and the value of human connection in a productive work environment.
