# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- relaxed - typist rotating slower reduces the amount of screen switching needed
- don't like feeling stupid; but today was ok
    - e.g. while being typist not understanding - "could you tell me where to go next?"
    - it's ok to do things (typing) w/o understanding
    - as a mobber - I will slow the team down - wanting to understand before we continue forward
- liked - new language for items in the backlog ("problem" vs "potential solutions") - gives a lot of context
- havent written any code
- nice to commit from the cli a multiline commit with all the authors by starting with a single quote that you don't close.
- liked the focus on th gameplay. we had a lot of focus on refactoring before that. can make the gameplay better.
- thankful to the team to be open to experiment with the workflow.

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- refining the language around our workflow ("problem" vs "potential solution")
- after defining the problem - elaborate (vs. lock-in) on potential solutions - it opens up the conversation
- +1 re-focus - "let's focus on game-play" - "let's explore/play the game"
- using a single timer for two cadences (typist / talker) - worked fine
- turn-based event for typists, timer-based event for talkers - less craziness
- single timer - single browser tab
- trying different things (rotating the typist slower), a little bit of variety; still curious to see how it works with "pure" coding
- being a reflective group to take time to think and share and experiment and learn

### Ideas

- [x] Be remembered of a random activity when using a timer every once in a while (put as "Goals" in mobtimer so can see)
    - Put activities of Roles in our timer to be remembered and more connected to the game
- [x] if everybody puts their timer tab in the browser to be the left-most tab - this consistency might make it easier on our eyes
- [ ] certain things can benefit from alone-time: should we allow for alone time pauses during a mob session?
- Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
