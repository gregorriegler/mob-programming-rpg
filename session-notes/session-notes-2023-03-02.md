 - N/A

Learn
 - Can repo be modified from _GitHub Codespaces_?
    - [YES] Via browser
    - [No] Via JetBrains Gateway (IntelliJ IDE)
    - [Yes] Via JetBrains Gateway (Visual Studio Code IDE)
    
Today, we learned...
- @MichaelRWolf can be author for changes to commit/push to origin/main.
- GitHub Code -> Codespaces Tab -> 
    - Open in Browser -- Works as expected
    - Open in JetBrains Gateway -- Launches gateway.  Launches codespace.  Downloads IDE (occasionally).  Does NOT start remote IDE backend or connect to Codespace.
    - Open in Visual Studio Code -- Works as expected.
- GitHub Code -> Local Tab -> 
   - Open with GitHub Desktop
     - Pull Origin -- Worked as expected
     - Open in your external editor (IntelliJ) -- Worked as expected



## Reflect

### How did that feel?

@MichaelRWolf 
 - felt happy that @gregorriegler took care of himself by _not_ participating in today's session.
 - felt proud that @gregorriegler added him as collaborator who can push to origin/main
 - felt alone and not as productive.  Mobs are fun AND productive.

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Taking care of self
- Using the microretro template file we created recently.
