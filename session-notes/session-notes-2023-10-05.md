# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

-   bubbling up what it is what we are actually trying to do
    -   a substitute for cursor AI
    -   we're trying to build our own thing
    -   we learned that the AI hallucinated a lot
-   worked best when we saw something on the screen
    -   then flow was going well
-   as soon as we started discussing only, we had different pictures in our heads
