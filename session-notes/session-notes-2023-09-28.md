## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- working on nitsans repo to create chatgpt scripts
  - https://github.com/nitsanavni/katas.git
- Interresting to have new people and new code after being away for a while
  - want attending last 2 weeks
  - it was comfortable being uncomfortable
- starting on a new project was confusing because it was not our default process
  - exploring a new thing
  - we were in learning mode
  - it was ok, was a fluid dance
- it felt right at home
- michael asked for typer/facilitator at the beginning of the retro
- excited about the whole subject of integrating ais into our work
- made an effort to get on the same page here
- tried some meta things here
  - appreciate it
  - cocreate
  - love this whole subject
- Excited today! Woody joining
- We were totally in an exploratory mode, with no idea what it would lead to...
  - all we needed was a timer :)
- had some tension about the path forward, three ideas; quickly closed it towards one of the options
- surprised: to put it as a comment first
  - think its more difficult

- surprised! cool!
  - we modified a bash script while it was running, and it kept going!
  - imagine gpt continuously generating the next thing to execute
- felt at home
  - when people work as a group they have their way of working
    - thats a good
- Ask: What was the best thing we were doing, how can we do it more?
  - What experiment can we do to get more of it?
- About Rotations:
  - The timer does help keep people enganged, but as the mob gets more mature, its maybe not that important
    - Idea: Free Fall
  - At hunter we were only rotating the driver
    - It was our way of making us feel comfortable
  - If I'm navigating, and I havent finished yet - why break the flow?
  - "I don't want to type anymore" - the rest of the team should respect that
  - "I think I can navigate this task", that person would be doing the navigating.
    - So they would leave the keyboard and navigate, and all others would rotate drivers
  - Another Idea is anybody could say: "I am the right one to do this"
  - "Navigate the navigator"
  - Would have a different order: First Talker then Typist
- Whiteboard: Diagrams is the most important thing
  - Can look at the diagram 10 Years later and know what it means, and how it came to be
  - Diagrams are great
  - If I explain an Idea I can explain it over and over
    - Showing it on a Diagram works better
  - Reluctant to use UML
    - Supercautios to use a formulated diagramming language
      - They create a contract 
    - Diagrams upfront cant work
    - Communication doesnt work so its a waste, we need to work on it together
  - as soon as you diagram you can prove the communication works
    - the more we communicate the more it fails
    - only communicate at the highest level of intent until details needed
    - want users in the mob
    - you are only starting to communicate once you work
  - a problem is how we thing of roles
    - we need to think about capabilities
  - didnt invent it, was experimenting with it for 10 years before it happened at hunter, became the "authoritative" person
    - trying to fill that role as responsible as possible
  - leaders are not born, they are torn into it when the time comes
  - joining a company where things didnt work well
    - open a little gap for somebody to jump in and fill it
    - be a crack opener
      - somebody is gonna come up and talk to, open a path
    - music is an easy connector
    - randori: powerfull learning mechanism
  - extreme Idea: write code in basic with gotos
  - "the future is in here now, its just not evenly distributed"
  - Woodys Workshop in France:
    - https://formation.hackyourjob.com/catalogue/mob-programming.html
  - Psychological safety
    - when everybody talks the same amount of time 'lagging indicator', that in the group people respect each other
  - one person struggling, all the other people benefiting from it in the sense that everybody is learning

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- The intention was "let's put this in the code"; Gregor suggested - "let's put it as a comment"
  - a non-destructive way to achieve the same goal
  - a great first step!
- We know this is wrong (putting it at the end of the file) - but let's test it anyway
- no matter the vision, the team needs to learn the basis
  - mob learning - mobbing to actively learn; and then -> doing mode
  - need to reach a shared vision, **before** moving forward
  - even when less fluent in the domain; can still learn
- when conflicts came up we rolled through it, that was good
- lets get to work, we will figure it out
- not allow the timer to break our flow
- going beyond the timer and noticing when the appropriate time is to transition from eg nitsan speaking to michael speaking


### Ideas

-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).
