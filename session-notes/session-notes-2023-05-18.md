# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- Vulnerable - awkward transitions, hard to get to agreement, but ok to ask questions; sometimes worried if self or other felt left out
- Safe - being organized / prepared for next development phase, using feature toggle, agreeing to use TDD, have a place for the new test
- at the end - felt good, agreed with strtuctured and safe approach
- stressful to follow what is going on, can't see all the component at once on the screen; overwhelmed about making changes to unfamiliar code.
    - this might be an opportunity to...
    - how would it have looked like if Nitsan navigated the whole thing
    - how to refactor a large component - extract smaller component? with the aim to make it more readable and easier to see at once

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Bringing up when veering from using timer or other agreements - making people aware / asking if ok to keep going that way
- Had an organized way to go about a feature - feature toggle, TDD
- Got to doing / making code changes; focused; avoided excessive time in backlog, etc.

### Ideas

- [ ] Consider ways to go slower. Notice when we feel the urge to go fast.
- [ ] "Read by refactoring" (to efficiently understand unfamiliar code)
- Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
