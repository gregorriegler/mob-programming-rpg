# Goal for Today
- refactor a test (the integration test)
    - the reason was - we wanted to refactor some primitive obsession

# Michael Notes
Keeping notes

Nitsan gave overview of test

Eddie noticed it's very big
s
Nitsan gave good summary

LEARN
DECIDE


Goal: DO - new integration test
Goal: DO - Refactor current test
Goal: LEARN - Learn by refactoring 


Goal: LEARN - Logic behind it/xit

# Retro

## How did that feel?
- Really productive today +1
- It goes really quick (only like 2,5 hours), but we got so much done
    - Happy
- Happy
    - Think its because of new people
- Love the fact that people come and go
- Ensemble seems to flow very well
- People who weren't here for a few weeks are still part of the process
- Very stressful (a lot of noise, hurting my brain)
    - Happy that you sticked despite it
- Interresting how quick it was to get into it (even though not knowing anything about the game) +1
- amazed - this worked very well today
    - solved many problems, in a short amount of time (co-authors, killing the server process)
- mentally drained - a lot learned
- the group feels calmer, more grounded, quiter, more productive; this compared to the recent previous sessions
- going for a shared pace (vs. competing) - let things play out
- slow is fast!!
- too many context switches

## What worked well, we want to do more of it?
- Clear Domain Language enabled progress
    - Started seing fruits
- Proved - helpful to work as a team even with new people
    - breaking Brook's law (from the Mythical Man-Month)
    - balancing "getting things **done**" and "getting things **learned**"
- 3 minute rotation - felt fine, better, worked well - a good comromise
- 3 minutes feels better than 2 minutes

# experiments
- 3 minute rotations
- typist becomes talker

## Findings
- Deployment Github Action not failing, even though server not running?




# Nitsan...
* We put server on time-out.  Took less than minute to cure multi-week (10 hours's work) pain.  Was left over from very beginning.
    Feeling: Happy
    Regret: Didn't do earlier
    Why so late:  Didn't occur to him earlier.  Became no-briner (once it was obvious).

* Immediately drawn to "applesauce".  It's like a book mark.
    Propoasl: Use this practice in future.  (Let 'bad' names draw attention to make better names.  (Arlo would call that 'getting more honest').  Acted like bookmark.)
    Observation: Name for 'clent' was good.  Felt good.  Made better sense than 'game'.  (This was benefit of investment over previous few weeks).  Names are not easy.  They take time.  We took the time.
    Observation: Drawing was very helpful to get group clarity on vocabulary.

# Tsvetan...
* Group dynamics - Felt that focus was on having fun.  Working together.  Can see how mob programming approach takes into account "laws of nature", and how they can/should(???) develop with time.
* Refactoring evolves.  Refactorings are puzzels.  Got to see this in a gruop context.  Alone vs group -- more ideas in a group.  Alone is slower and inferior.
* Introductions (here/there???) were (beter/worse/different??).
* Timer is a gentle reminder.  Proposal or observation?????  Tsvetan????
* Don't feel ???? to talk.  If this works as well at work, can't imagine how work could be tiring.  It doesn't always work as well.   But it is a great inspiration to bring back with you.

# rea...
* Code continually got shorter and shorter.

We prioritize learning together.  Letting things flow feels good.

# Relaxed-ness
Observation: Timer is reminder, not strict.
Question:  What would 'strict' look like?  If we were very strict about timer?  Gains?  Losses?

# Michael...
* Ideas flow and are accepted

# For next time...
## Code
Line 146-147 -- Possible bug.  May be comparing something to itself.

## Experiments??
Question:  What are the boundaries to tight/loose transitions.
Hypothesis:  Having tight agreement on how/when to transition will free us to focus on the code (instead of renegotiating the trade off).
Proposal:  More strict about to-the-second transition time.  Transition at the end of the clock (not the end of a thought).
