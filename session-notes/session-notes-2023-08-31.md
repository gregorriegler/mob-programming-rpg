# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

-   Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

-   Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- Thought Y got annoyed with Chat
- Y felt frustrated
  - It looked like we made it more complicated than it needed to be
  - Its about an echo, but I didnt bring it up
  - Emotions were informing that it was a waste of time
  - Question is "why we are doing it this way?"
  - Then I just backed off and let the momentum go
- X felt interrest in exploring it with Chat, even if it took longer
- I feel like, is was about *bash scripting*, having one person being an expert in this space - so by going to chat it *took away* the opportunity to bash script!
  - yes, it was a trade-off: learning chatgpt vs. someone contributing directly
- Also, other people feel excited about exploring how far we can go with chatGPT - conflicting motivations
- yes, we had different ideas about what to do
  - how do we want to handle these kinds of conflict?
  - this time - the navigator said "I'd like to go forward with the AI", but we kept discussing
  - meaning we did not defer to the navigator
  - we switched navigator and typist, like dancing
- awkward rotating while using the AI (chatgpt, bard, claude)
  - we don't all have the same tools
  - the chats are not shared
  - also - outages with chatgpt
    - its the first time I see stackoverflow in a long time (see ChatGPT usually)
- the thing about chat is to still be in the loop, because you need to review it. but you don't have to generate it.
  - it's like offloading some of the mental strain
  - when I code its like you have to write and maybe review
  - you become a validator rather than a creator
    - maybe - there are different things to learn - e.g. being a better validator; to better prepare for the future of programming; a shift from creating code to vaidating code
- lean on the compiler: when writing the code as we intend it to be, then lean on the compiler and "make this exist please"
  - in the future, let's "lean on the AI"; offloading mental loads to tools
  - eventually, we want the AI to be a fully-fledged member of the mob
- Feel we are in sync with our rigorous coding workflow +1
  - small steps
  - unspoken fundamentals
  - this makes us more productive because we dont have to revisit them


### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- +1 working with the old timer is much better! https://mobtime.fly.dev/friendly-grid?
  - had some issues with the sound

### Ideas

- IDE like VSCode for AI: Cursor
  - It adds some AI Tooling into the mix.
    - Think its amazing, you can chat with your code. Chat becomes typist
    - Its not possible with GitPod
    - Nitsan could drive for one hour so we could try it out
    - proposal - do it with a kata, e.g. Roman Numerals
    - there's a trade-off between "easy to use" and "power user friendly"

-   Consider creating a backlog item if the idea is something we want to implement in a future mobbing session in [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
    for an idea (that was generated at this retro).

## Summary (Generated by ChatGPT)

Useful command for today's changes:

```shell
git diff --ignore-all-space `git log --since="1 day ago" --pretty=format:%H | tail -1`
```

Useful prompts:

```
Here are all the changes made to the repo during a single mob programming session

could you please summarize what happened?
what are some main points from the retro that was help at the end?
```

```
here are notes from today's mob programming session retro

please summarize
and aslo - go up one or two levels asking "why?" (values, etc.)
```
