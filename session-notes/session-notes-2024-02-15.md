### Mid-Session Retro 1 (1 minute per person - what liked/disliked & propose changes)

Diana
- Loved this, fulfilling my needs; feel honored to get to choose what we did today; it was what I wanted
- I would save the links to the AI chats in cyber-dojo or gitpod session notes

Gregor
- I liked this idea - coding with GPT.
- Opinion - you can tackle anything this way (with GPT); have faith you will understand.

Nitsan
- Surprised by last prompt; results were great. New test looks more promising. Like a rachet
- Asked about Bing.com chat access. Answer: free for all, running GPT-4

Joel
- Find it interesting
- Liked - asked to make the method -> let's do both the test and the production code
- a bit more complicated due to the new language - Perl
- Like - to keep going this way
