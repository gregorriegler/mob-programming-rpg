## How did that feel?
- Really good
- Energized
- Engaged
- Happy
- Looking Forward
- Productive and Compotent
- Relieved to (finally) get the README updated.
- Collaborative (not fighting) about the differences.  Valuing all opinions and impring all the time.

Observations:
- Working with text is constant restructuring.  It worked well, and felt productive.  Good to have multiple views.
- All first drafts are shit.  THe art comes in the rewrite.  Tyhis is true of text and code.  Both.  Iterations work!
- A lesson to learn -- You have to own your code.  And live with it.  This does not happen in college.  It does happen here... (e.g. README)
- I want my future to be easy (so I invest time now).  Clean code is selfish.  And responsible.  Check the context.
- The game must fit the skills of the work (that want to get improved).


## What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Improv warm-up (Story Spine) worked well with 3 people.
- Practicing warm-up game will help team get better (at the story, and also collaborating in general).
