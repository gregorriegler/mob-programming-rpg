### How did that feel?

- When we take the time, and move "slow" getting ready - building a common understanding, we will beat the sh**t out of this thing later!
  - Fun! - When working with other people - it amplifies this phenomenon
- Interesting - so many perspective on such a "small" thing
- +1 Inspired, TlDraw - make it visual, easy whiteboard
- Helpful - having a separate file for the new feature brainstorm notes
- Frustrated / Uncomfortable - someone would get talking (a lot) - wondering - should we modify this behavior? vs. ... not?
  - taking a thought all the way to its end, even if the timer's up
  - vs. trying to punctuate with the 3m flow
  - should we support each other in **keep** talking and support people to **stop** talking
  - doing vs. quality - when we collaborate quality goes up
  - Like that we're not strict about the timer
  - When brainstorming - should it be the regular mobbing flow? Feels like not; maybe there shoudn't be a timer at all for brainstorming
  - I was not sure if everybody else was ok with it
- Thought it was a very fruitful discussion in the brainstorming
  - I do feel we really did collaborate
- We very smoothly transitioned into mobbing (from demoing something)
- Nice that we tested Joels mob timer project (at least for a bit) and found valuable feedback
- I liked that the typist rotated slower
- I disliked that the typist rotated slower
  - Felt like a long time when I was typing, but was ok when other people were typing.
  - It took long because we didn't always respect the timer
    - Idea: Have a separate timer for the typist to make sure we rotate them
- We're constantly learning from each other

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- show and tell (tdd machine)
- micro retro - feedback - "how was it now?", "was very concise"
- note taking - makes you feel heard
- Gather, screenshare, links in the chat - easy context onboarding

### Ideas

- [ ] Have a separate timer for the typist to make sure we rotate them
- [ ] brainstorming on a shared document in a mobbing style
- [ ] use a chess timer for brainstorming - speak at will, but with a timebox
- [ ] You talk and after 3 min your volume gets decreased
- [ ] Finger up: I think we are violating our working agreements (just takes a few seconds)
- [ ] Adapt to what we are doing.. "we are starting a brainstorming, lets drop the timer."
- [ ] Use gather town emojis as a signaling system
- [ ] Having a designated facilitator when the groupsize is 4 or more people
- [ ] Read through working agreements in the beginning of a session
  - [ ] When we dont adhere to it, people can raise their hand or something
- [ ] It should be ok for anybody to interrupt 10 seconds and say they're feeling uncomfortable

- Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)


### Story
- In another mob, using an extension called Talktime I noticed there was a person saying only 3 words in the entire session
