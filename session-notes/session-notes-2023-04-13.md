# Agenda

## Bond (15 min.)

- Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Work the Backlog (75 min.)

- Consider checking the recent `git log -p`
- Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Leave Breadcrumbs (5 min.)

- Update the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect / Retro (25 min.)

### How did that feel?

- FEELINGS??
- Unsafe (fear that we have blind spot and can't trust our CI)
- Unsafe++
- feels great at the end; in the middle - awkward
- going too fast / too slow;
- typer - sometimes did too much, but sometimes it's a good thing - do we have to ask permission for everything?
- felt great slowing down for better understanding!
- fun to do things a little different
- feels good to accomplish some things, and also idetified potential improvements for DevX

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Changing from 3 to 4 felt nice. More relaxed. Less overwhelm. But not all around. Prevented task-switching that was small, but not insignificant.
- Liked that we tried something different (even if we didn't like it).
- Liked - in the very beginging; we're still in the warm-up; and Michael saying "I'm Michael and I'm Typing"
- Liked - continuous improvements, including the working agreements (e.g. the new "As we go..." section), also - the process (e.g. 4 minute timer)
- Liked - keep the process, live it, don't skip; this allows us to improve it
- Liked - slow down in the short term (e.g. explain something that wasn't clear), allows us to go faster in the long term

#### Observations

- ??? about hive mind.
- We don't have (immediate) feedback on a broken CI.
- TS compiler is doing 2 hings. We can use it for just one (or the other).
  - type checking
  - transpiling
- jest (our test runner) binds the 2 together, so we'd have to configure to do one or the other (not both). We want to do _both_.
- [x] add above ^^^ to backlog

### Idea

- Experiment for next time: Try rotating typist slower than talker, and reverting 4-minute timer to 3-minutes. Nitsan uses 2 timers.
- Create 'dashboard' or 'status script' that tells us everything we want to know (about code and about build process).

- Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
