# learned
- ECS version typescript target

# Agenda

## Bond

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Goals

-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect

### How did that feel?

- Happy +1
- Nice to come back after skipping 1 session
- A good variety of work
    - Improvement of environment
    - Refactoring
    - Backlog improvement (organizing)
- Learning is fun
    - Especially when you can use it later
- Took a review of what should be done
    - The Backlog did help with that
    - Noticed the yaml file is a low hanging fruit (tells gitpod to start the app in the beginning)
    - When Gregor opened a new workspace he saw it working
- This Group feels relaxed, easy going
    - It makes for a pleasant working environment

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Actually doing the retro
- We're kind of familiar with each others habits
    - Have a shared culture, makes it smoother, and **we can focus on the content**


### Idea

- Agenda to remind ourselves about doing a retro after the the first shift
    - Have a bot remind us
    - Setting a timer
- Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
