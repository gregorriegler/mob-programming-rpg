# Agenda

## Bond

-   Try a [warmup exercise](../docs/warmup-exercises.md)

## Goals

-   Review what happened in the first session
-   Refactor rename Roles that should be called Position instead as discussed with Willem [](../docs/rpg-terminology.png)
-   Review previous primitive obsession work and see if we can continue it
-   Stay alert for Gitpod actions that might be helpful
-   Check the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)

## Reflect

### How did that feel?

- Happy Dance
- Felt Productive
- Liked the way we did small commits
- We improved a lot but we also learned a lot, and we also learned a lot we want to improve
- Driving for a long time can be exhausting
- Glad we kept going
- Did get a chance to think
- Leaning forward trying to follow
- By eliminating switching keyboards/screen I had room to learn more
- Slowing down had advantages for all
- Great session

### What worked well, we want to do more of it?

- Keeping the same position
- Following the needs of the partner instead of the clock
- Patience
- Reminding to focus on completion "lets solve one problem at a time"
    - Capturing todo, but not doing it now
- Checking in as soon as we got green

### Idea
- Since we have to places with goals (retro, backlog), its unclear which one to follow
- Also, for completing goals, the backlog uses a different pattern (moving lines around)
-   Write your Ideas to the [global backlog](../docs/backlog.md)
