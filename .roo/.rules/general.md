# Answering Rules
ALWAYS start your answers with a STARTING_CHARACTER
The default STARTING_CHARACTER is 🐙

I prefer SHORT, SUCCINCT and CONCISE answers over long ones

# Coding Rules
NEVER USE COMMENTS

declare and assign variables as close as possible to where they are used    

I prefer SIMPLE design with fewer elements

run the tests after each change using just `npm test`
